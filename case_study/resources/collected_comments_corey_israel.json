I came not of my own accord, but he (Elah) sent me.\u201cO you who have been given the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Believe in what We have revealed (to Muhammad) confirming what is (already) with you...\u201d (Quran 4:46)WHY I CONVERTED TO ISLAM-\u00a0I Got 13 VALID REASONS WHY AND HOW MUSLIMS ARE LIKE JESUS (PBUH) AND TRUER FOLLOWERS OF JESUS THAN MOST CHRISTIANS BELIEVE:1. Jesus (pbuh) taught that there is only One God and Only God should be worshipped as taught in Deut 6:4, Mark 12:29.Muslims also believe this as taught in the Qur'an verse 4:171.2. Jesus (pbuh) didn't eat pork as taught in Leviticus 11:7, and neither do Muslims as taught in the Qur'an verse 6:145.3. Jesus (pbuh) greeted with the words \"As-salaam alaikum\" (Peace be with you), in John 20:21.Muslims also greet each other this way.4. Jesus (pbuh) always said \"God Willing\" (inshallah), Muslims say this too before doing anything as taught in the Qur'an verses 18:23-24.5. Jesus (pbuh) washed his face, hands, and feet before praying. The Muslims do the same.6. Jesus (pbuh) and other prophets of the Bible prayed with their head to the ground see (Matthew26:39).Muslims do too as taught in the Qur'an verse 3:43.7. Jesus (pbuh) had a beard and wore a throbe. It is Sunnah for Muslim men to do the same.8. Jesus (pbuh) followed the law and believed in all the prophets, see (Matthew 5:17).Muslims do too as taught in the Qur'an verses 3:84, and 2:285.9. Jesus' mother Maryam (pbuh) dressed modestly by fully covering her body and wearing a headscarf (hijab) as found in 1 Timothy 2:9, Genesis 24:64-65, and Corinthians 11:6.Muslim women modestly dress the same as taught in the Qur'an verse 33:59.10. Jesus (pbuh) and other prophets of the Bible fasted up to 40 days see (Exodus 34:28, Daniel 10:2-6, 1Kings 19:8, and Matthew 4:1.\u00a0Muslims do so also during the month of Ramadan.Muslims are required to fast the full obligatory 30 days (see Qur'an 2:183), and others take it a step further by fasting an additional 6 days to increase their rewards.11. Jesus (pbuh) taught to say \"Peace to this house\" when entering it see (Luke 10:5), and to also greet the people in the house with \"peace be unto you\".\u00a0Muslims do exactly what Jesus did and taught. When we enter our homes and the homes of others we say \"Bismillah\" and also greet with \"as salaamu alaikum\" (peace be upon you) as taught in the Qur'an verse 24:61.12. Jesus (pbuh) was circumcised. Circumcision is 1 of the 5 fitrah in Islam, so Muslim men are required to be circumcised.According to the Bible in Luke 2:21, Jesus was eight days old when he was circumcised. In the Torah, Allah/God stated to the Prophet Abraham (pbuh) that it is an \"Everlasting covenant\" (see Genesis 17:13).In the Qur'an verse 16:123 Muslims are required to follow the religion of Abraham. The Prophet Muhammad (saws) said, \"The Prophet Abraham circumcised himself when he was eighty years old.\" (see Sahih hadith Bukhari, Muslim, and Ahmad).13. Jesus (pbuh) spoke aramaic and called God \"Elah\", which is pronounced the same as \"Allah\".Aramaic is an ancient, Biblical language. It is one of the Semitic languages that also include Hebrew, Arabic, Ethiopic and the ancient Assyrian and Babylonian language of Akkadian.The Aramaic \"Elah\" and the Arabic \"Allah\" are the same.The Aramaic \"Elah\" is derived from the Arabic \"Allah\", and it means \"GOD\".\"Allah\" in Arabic also means \"GOD\", the Supreme GOD Almighty.You can easily see the similarity in their pronunciation so this concludes that the God of Jesus is also the God of the Muslims, of all mankind, and all that exist.Now tell me who is the real follower of Jesus (pbuh)?\u00a0Obviously Muslims.Now I believe am a true follower of Jesus PBUH.\u00a0You shall not murder. \u00a0Exodus 20:13For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to pluck up what is planted.Ecclesiastes 3: 1-4'When their time....arrives they cannot tarry for a single hour nor can they go ahead'. \u00a0Al Quran Surah 16:61A sincere Christian and a Jew are those of your brothers in Faith. Muslim's Believe.\u00a0'What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul' Christianity Mathew 16:26Your Body is a Temple: 1 Corinthian 6:19\u00a0(My interpretation: Eat junk food be junky alike, eat healthy food be Wealthy alike.)Muslims don't call them-self, we are Mohamadism! But Muslim in Arabic = Meaning He who submit & believes!\u00a0Just like God in Hebrew is Elohim and in Aramaic is Ela and also in Arabic is Allah.\u00a0Elohim, Ela and Allah sound the same to me!Muslim's believe in the Torah Tenakh Gospel and the Al Quran.What do Muslim say about Mary and the Jews & ChristianGod sent the Angel to Mary and said \" O Mary indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and be devoutly obedient to your lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow in prayer . O Mary indeed Allah give you the Messiah Jesus (PBUH). He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous\". She said \"My lord how will i have a child when no man has touched me\". \"When he (Allah) decrees a matter He only says to it BE and it will Be, He will (Jesus) teach him writing and Wisdom and the Torah and Gospel\". Surah Ali Imran 3:42 AL QURANCONCEPT OF GOD & JESUS IN ISLAM VS. CHRISTIANITY - (The MOST TOUCHING PART!!)https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8jVxKgxvhAUThe enemy of faith call Jews, Jews because that they were from Jerusalem, and Christians because they followed christ.\u00a0O mankind, We have created you from a male and a female and have made you into nations and tribes for you to know one another. Truly, the noblest of you with God is the most pious.2 Truly, God is All-Knowing, All-Aware.\u00a0(Quran, 49:13)Islam rejects certain individuals or nations being favored because of their wealth, power, or race.

A chapter that We have revealed, and made obligatory, and revealed in it clear Verses, that you may take heed.2. The adulteress and the adulterer\u2014whip each one of them a hundred lashes, and let no pity towards them overcome you regarding God\u2019s Law, if you believe in God and the Last Day. And let a group of believers witness their punishment.3. The adulterer shall marry none but an adulteress or an idolatress; and the adulteress shall marry none but an adulterer or an idolater. That has been prohibited for the believers.4. Those who accuse chaste women, then cannot bring four witnesses, whip them eighty lashes, and do not ever accept their testimony. For these are the immoral.5. Except for those who repent afterwards, and reform; for God is Forgiving and Merciful.6. As for those who accuse their own spouses, but have no witnesses except themselves, the testimony of one of them is equivalent to four testimonies, if he swears by God that he is truthful.7. And the fifth time, that God\u2019s curse be upon him, if he is a liar.8. But punishment shall be averted from her, if she swears four times by God, that he is a liar.9. And the fifth time, that God\u2019s wrath be upon her, if he is truthful.10. Were it not for God\u2019s grace upon you, and His mercy, and that God is Conciliatory and Wise.11. Those who perpetrated the slander are a band of you. Do not consider it bad for you, but it is good for you. Each person among them bears his share in the sin. As for him who played the major role\u2014for him is a terrible punishment.12. Why, when you heard about it, the believing men and women did not think well of one another, and say, \u201cThis is an obvious lie\u201d?13. Why did they not bring four witnesses to testify to it? If they fail to bring the witnesses, then in God\u2019s sight, they are liars.14. Were it not for God\u2019s favor upon you, and His mercy, in this world and the Hereafter, you would have suffered a great punishment for what you have ventured into.15. When you rumored it with your tongues, and spoke with your mouths what you had no knowledge of, and you considered it trivial; but according to God, it is serious.16. When you heard it, you should have said, \u201cIt is not for us to repeat this. By Your glory, this is a serious slander.\u201d17. God cautions you never to return to the like of it, if you are believers.18. God explains the Verses to you. God is Knowing and Wise.19. Those who love to see immorality spread among the believers\u2014for them is a painful punishment, in this life and in the Hereafter. God knows, and you do not know.20. Were it not for God\u2019s grace upon you, and His mercy, and that God is Clement and Merciful.21. O you who believe! Do not follow Satan\u2019s footsteps. Whoever follows Satan\u2019s footsteps\u2014he advocates obscenity and immorality. Were it not for God\u2019s grace towards you, and His mercy, not one of you would have been pure, ever. But God purifies whomever He wills. God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.22. Those of you who have affluence and means should not refuse to give to the relatives, and the needy, and the emigrants for the sake of God. And let them pardon, and let them overlook. Do you not love for God to pardon you? God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.23. Those who slander honorable, innocent, believing women are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter. They will have a terrible punishment.24. On the Day when their tongues, and their hands, and their feet will testify against them regarding what they used to do.25. On that Day, God will pay them their account in full, and they will know that God is the Evident Reality.26. Bad women are for bad men, and bad men are for bad women, and good women are for good men, and good men are for good women. Those are acquitted of what they say. There is forgiveness for them, and a generous provision.27. O you who believe! Do not enter homes other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted their occupants. That is better for you, that you may be aware.28. And if you find no one in them, do not enter them until you are given permission. And if it is said to you, \u201cTurn back,\u201d then turn back. That is more proper for you. God is aware of what you do.29. There is no blame on you for entering uninhabited houses, in which are belongings of yours. God knows what you reveal and what you conceal.30. Tell the believing men to restrain their looks, and to guard their privates. That is purer for them. God is cognizant of what they do.31. And tell the believing women to restrain their looks, and to guard their privates, and not display their beauty except what is apparent thereof, and to draw their coverings over their breasts, and not expose their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, what their right hands possess, their male attendants who have no sexual desires, or children who are not yet aware of the nakedness of women. And they should not strike their feet to draw attention to their hidden beauty. And repent to God, all of you believers, so that you may succeed.32. And wed the singles among you, and those who are fit among your servants and maids. If they are poor, God will enrich them from His bounty. God is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.33. And let those who do not find the means to marry abstain, until God enriches them from His bounty. If any of your servants wish to be freed, grant them their wish, if you recognize some good in them. And give them of God\u2019s wealth which he has given you. And do not compel your girls to prostitution, seeking the materials of this life, if they desire to remain chaste. Should anyone compel them\u2014after their compulsion, God is Forgiving and Merciful.34. We have sent down to you clarifying revelations, and examples of those who passed on before you, and advice for the righteous.35. God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The allegory of His light is that of a pillar on which is a lamp. The lamp is within a glass. The glass is like a brilliant planet, fueled by a blessed tree, an olive tree, neither eastern nor western. Its oil would almost illuminate, even if no fire has touched it. Light upon Light. God guides to His light whomever He wills. God thus cites the parables for the people. God is cognizant of everything.36. In houses which God has permitted to be raised, and His name is celebrated therein. He is glorified therein, morning and evening.37. By men who neither trading nor commerce distracts them from God\u2019s remembrance, and from performing the prayers, and from giving alms. They fear a Day when hearts and sights are overturned.38. God will reward them according to the best of what they did, and He will increase them from His bounty. God provides for whomever He wills without reckoning.39. As for those who disbelieve, their works are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty assumes it is to be water. Until, when he has reached it, he finds it to be nothing, but there he finds God, Who settles his account in full. God is swift in reckoning.", "people say it is their choices,  it is no choice it is whom they are.", "3:04 My respect for them \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8", "\u05ea\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9, \u05db\u05e7\u05d5\u05e7\u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e4\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05d3 \u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05da\u05d4 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e1\u05e8\u05d8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc\u05da. \u05ea\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05da \u05dc\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d0.\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \ud83d\udc9c", "I can't even watch it.", "Complete Jewish Bible \u2721 [Mark 2:16-17] When the Torah-teachers and the P\u2019rushim saw that he was eating with sinners and tax-collectors, they said to his talmidim, \u201cWhy does he eat with tax-collectors and sinners?\u201d But, hearing the question, Yeshua answered them, \u201cThe ones who need a doctor aren\u2019t the healthy but the sick.

USA bad, Soviet Union good.So, because USA always supported Israel while Soviet Union supported arabs and palestinians, the left wingers \"hated\" also Israel. They opposed Israel mainly due to the USA support, and that's the only logical explanation.Even though Soviet Union is no more, the bias against Israel (due to USA) has continued to this day.

But we're supposed to go out of our way to make other Gerim feel comfortable, so while I understand that on the level of human nature, it's understandable, there's really no excuse to treat converts poorly.Now, on the question of who is a convert: converting to Judaism isn't converting to a religion. It's converting to a peoplehood. You can't snap your fingers and convert to Indian, or Chinese. The same with Judaism. You have to undergo the full process. All things real take time, and it's usually clear that when someone undergoes a reform \"conversion\" it usually doesn't last, or becomes something unrecognizable. It's not hard to see why - reform is basically the modern day version of Christianity. Someone who converts via reform is not Jewish. They have converted to the religion of whatever reform \"Judaism\" is. This is the truth, even though it might hurt for some. Now, someone who converts via the correct route may become non-religious, but they are still Jewish, and are now fully responsible for all the sins they transgress, and the mitzvos they keep. That's why conversions should never be taken lightly.", "You should ask converts what the reasons are. I'm a convert and I have lots to say.

It did, and regardless Israel fought them.

Look up the War On The Rocks article about that.-Border skirmish with Israel in Syria around November 2016. Started as a firefight with a IS element that climbed towards an Israeli outpost. Israeli infantry were able to repeal them, and a building in Syria where other ISIS elements were placed got airstriked. The results of the firefight were posted on YouTube, try searching \"israel Vs Islamic state\" or something of that effect.In Israel: The only thing I know of is a 3 men strong attack in Jerusalem in 2017 I think, that ISIS took credit for, but other armed Palesinian groups claimed that they were lying and that it was them.In the West Bank:One of the only famous cases of the Palestinian Preventive Security actually functioning against terrorism was a case where they stopped an ISIS attack inside Israel, that was around 2018 if I recall.On the Egyptian front:This is where most of it is. The Sinai based Ansar Beit Al Maqdis, a group which swore loyalty to ISIS and thus became al-Daoula al-Islamia Wilayat Sanaa, or ISIS in the Sinai, is responsible for:Blowing up Gas pipes going through Egypt to Israel, and an assault on Israeli soldiers on the border in a separate incident. Also shooting rockets at Eilat, although they were intercepted I think. There were other cross border raids since they became a thing, but I don't know which ones were necessarily theirs, like the ATGM attack in 2011.More importantly al-Sisi said in an interview that Israel bombed hundreds of ISIS targets with his approval in the Sinai around 2019-2018. There's a picture taken from a video from around the period of 2019 on an blog by Joe Truzman, where an ISIS member presents the munition dropped on them from the sky, surprise surprise, the inscription on it is in Hebrew.A few of the thwarted worldwide terrorism ISIS attacks were thanks to Israeli intelligence.
