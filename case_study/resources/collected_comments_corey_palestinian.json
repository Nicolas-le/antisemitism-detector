There is a maximum penalty and it also revolves around human dignity when it comes to punishment. 40 beats used to be survived, but probably not always. Nevertheless, the guilty man is seen as a brother of mankind from whom one cannot take away all honor.to verse 4. Now comes the leap of thought, before it turns to guilty parties and punishments. Now it's about animals doing the work. These beings have not committed any crimes but they work. It is the enhancement of stealing human dignity. Now they call people disparagingly stupid animals, these people take care of their livelihood and the livelihood of their families with their work. Now they are ordered to bandage their mouths (so that they are plagued by being deprived of the air they breathe. A kind of torture even though they are innocent). In 1 Cor 9,9 and 1 Tim 5,18 Paul already points out that it is not about oxen but about people. Here about apostles who deserve their wages for their work. However, this is not the only type of interpretation, although it is correct. In His Word God shows again and again something new that people learn and understand.If you no longer see people as human beings but as slaughter cattle (ox), this is an increase in the punishment (torture). Connecting the mouth fully applies to the present day. Go shopping and you will see a lot of oxen. God told people this over 3000 years ago and this prophecy will be recognized at the end of the day. God said that you shouldn't do that and people who order this do not do God's will, but the opposite of it. Satan only wants to kill, steal and destroy.But Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life.

My question would be for the muslim or for anyone's faith/religion is God by definition must be perfect in every way, because if God were not perfect then that faith wouldn't be the true religion since if their God or gods were not perfect then an imperfect God or gods doesn't make any sense since God by definition must be perfect lest there by a flawed God or gods. So how is the muslim God/Allah perfect in every way? Speaking of God's perfect righteous justice towards sin/evil. All sin throughout their who lives whether it being in the mind, or what they have said, or what they have done. So how does the muslim God deal with all the debt of sin/evil for the believer since God's justice must be perfect, it therefore has to be paid in full somehow, lest God's justice be flawed making it unrighteous/imperfect therefore an imperfect God. On the other hand, how is the muslim God perfect in love? How does the muslim God demonstrate love to us? A question that atheists ask monotheists is, \"what was God doing before He created the universe?\" In other words, if the muslim God is perfect, but only 1 God, then who could God talk to, or love, or have love shown back to Him \"a loving relationship\". So basically for all eternity, God would be alone to have no one to have a loving relationship with, so therefore, God would have to create another being who is capable of love in order that God would be able to finally share and have love shown back to him. If this is the case, then since God had to create in order to experience a loving relationship, then that would mean that this God would be lacking, and dependent upon another being in order to experience this most beautiful thing called love. If God is lacking and dependent upon another being in order to experience the most beautiful thing called love, then that would be an imperfect God and therefore not the true God. So how does the muslim faith answer these questions. I haven't gotten an actual answer from a muslim on these questions yet if you could possibly answer them for me.

For example , the interviewer asked why don't prisoners explain their crimes... one obvious reason is that prisoners dont want to go over things they did in the past because they are afraid of inadvertently getting themselves in trouble again. You were already accused of a political crime and went to jail so why explain then go over it again in detail in front of a foreign interviewer?
